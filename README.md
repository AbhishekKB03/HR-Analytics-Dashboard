# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Main thought in creating this dashboard is to help the organization to improve employee performance and improve employees retention (reduce attrition) by creating a HR Analytics dashboard.

## Project Structure:
- Data: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- Scripts: Includes any scripts or code used in the data transformation process.
- Visualizations: Stores the Power BI files and exported images of visualizations.
- Docs: Documentation files, including this README.

## Insights:
- Here I used raw HR Analytics data and imported data to power BI. I implemented cleaning and processing and included charts and table to make it more clear to the client.
- With visually engaging charts, graphs, and interactive features, this dashboard allows you to explore key HR analytics such as employee turnover, performance, recruitment, metrics, training effectiveness, diversity, and more. It provides a comprehensive view of your organization's workforce, enabling data-driven HR strategies and optimization.
- The HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI offers real-time updates, ensuring you have access to the most up-to-date HR data. It also facilitates the comparison of HR metrics across different time period or benchmarked against industry standards , providing valuable insights for performance evaluation and improvement.
